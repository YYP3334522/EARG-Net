# EARG-Net:Edge-Aware Reconstruction-Guided Network for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (AAAI2026）
## Abstract
Recent advances in image editing tools, particularly those used in content-aware retouching and object-level manipulation, have raised significant concerns regarding the authenticity of digital images. While many Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL) methods have been proposed, they often struggle with subtle forgeries, intricate boundary artifacts, and manipulations generated by unseen editing techniques. In this work, we propose a novel edge-aware framework that leverages the strong natural image priors of pre-trained inpainting models to harmonize manipulated regions. By guiding the inpainting process with generated edge-aware masks, our method reconstructs tampered areas using surrounding context, yielding perceptually coherent results. The pixel-wise residual between the original and reconstructed images reveals manipulation-sensitive inconsistencies—particularly around editing boundaries—thereby enabling accurate and generalizable detection and localization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in challenging scenarios involving realistic and finely retouched image forgeries.
